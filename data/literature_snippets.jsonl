{"id": "spin_001", "source": "Electrospinning handbook (summary note)", "text": "For aqueous polymer blends, stable fibre formation often occurs when total polymer loading is 10-22 wt%. Below this, beads appear; above this, viscosity can limit jet stability. Humidity 30-50% is a common window for repeatable morphologies."}
{"id": "spin_002", "source": "Lab note: WPU/gelatin blends", "text": "In WPU/gelatin electrospinning, voltage 12-20 kV and tip-to-collector distance 12-18 cm are typical. Increasing voltage tends to reduce fibre diameter, while increasing flow rate increases diameter and bead formation."}
{"id": "spin_003", "source": "PEI-containing fibres (summary note)", "text": "Cationic additives such as PEI can enhance antimicrobial activity but may reduce cytocompatibility at high loadings. Practical ranges are often 0.5-3 wt% relative to total solution, with optimisation required for balancing activity and viability."}
{"id": "spin_004", "source": "Humidity effects (summary note)", "text": "Humidity 25-45% often improves uniformity for many aqueous systems, whereas humidity above 55% can increase bead density and broaden the diameter distribution. Flow rate 0.3-1.0 mL/h is typical for lab-scale syringes."}
{"id": "spin_005", "source": "Bio-additive functionalisation (summary note)", "text": "Allantoin and hyaluronic acid are frequently used to improve skin compatibility. Additive loading is commonly below 3 wt% total to avoid disrupting fibre formation."}
